## About Me

My name is **Richard Shu** and I am a first year PhD student in Biostatistics at _Milken Institue School of Public Health_ at the [George Washington University](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/biostatistics-and-bioinformatics). I am originally from _Dalian, China_, and spent my last six years here in the US. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Economics at _Vassar College_, while studying abroad for one semester at _St. Edmund Hall, Oxford University_. I received my master degree in statistics at _Carnegie Mellon University_.

During the year of Covid-19 pandemic, I chose to join a Federally Qualified Health Center(**FQHC**) in rural Arizona, and this work experience got me into biostatistics. Throughout my work experience, I not only refined my coding skills in R, Python and SQL, but also learnt various aspects of public health. I realized the importance of public health and the immediate need of public health professionals. I hope to become a field expert with my education here at GWU.

## Current Life

I currently live in Arlington, Virginia with my partner Tammy and two wonderful kittens, McSwirl and Charlie, an American Shorthair and a Havana Brown. You can see their pictures below. Besides school work, I also work at the Biostatistics Center of GWU, within the group of Diabetics Prevention Program under the guidance of Dr.Marinella Temprosa. I am still exploring my dissertation interest, so please feel free to reach out to me if you have any great research ideas!
